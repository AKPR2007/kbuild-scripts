Just Noob Script, XD

## To simplify compile kernel in local and CI

### For CI, see in "build-ci" folder
```
Compatible with DroneCI and CircleCI
I only use those two Cloud CI
```
##### *Here for My [DroneCI & CircleCI](https://github.com/okta-10/mystic-blender.git) setup*

###### *For CircleCI you need clone the Kernel Source from .config.yml [(See this)](https://github.com/okta-10/mystic-blender/blob/msm-4.4/.circleci/config.yml#L7)*

###### *For DroneCI you can clone the Kernel Source from Script*

##

### For local, see in "build-local" folder
``` 
Just put a script in your Kernel Source.
Then run using Terminal with the command
"./build.sh" or "bash build.sh" without quotes.
```
